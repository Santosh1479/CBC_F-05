Q9. Describe the role of "Edge Computing" in IoT and why it is becoming increasingly important.
Answer: Edge computing involves processing data closer to the source of the data (e.g., the IoT devices themselves) rather than sending it all to a central cloud server. It reduces latency, conserves bandwidth, improves security, and enables real-time decision-making, which is crucial for applications like autonomous vehicles and industrial automation.

Q10. Explain the importance of considering scalability during the design phase of an IoT project. What are two strategies that can be employed to ensure scalability?
Answer: Scalability is critical to ensure an IoT system can handle a growing number of devices, increasing data volumes, and evolving user demands without performance degradation or system failures. Two strategies for ensuring scalability are: 1) Utilizing cloud-based infrastructure for flexible resource allocation and management. 2) Implementing a microservices architecture to decouple functionalities and allow independent scaling of individual components.
